  "results.pc": "Video games have become part of our lives, as virtual realities and escape places we all access for new experiences. PC is one of the platforms with more innovation in its history due to a more diverse, modular set of hardware and, in general, a more powerful one. PCs always had the advantage of being highly configurable based on available hardware, as well as personal preferences.",
  "results.client": "Having a standalone client is a great solution for larger games that would be hindered by web browser limitations. Modern game engines like Unreal and Unity offer great support and a lot of options in terms of assets, plugin and other modules that could be used.\n\nEven with digital content downloaded to their own sistem from a server, players get the feeling of ownership, the same feeling people get when buying physical copies.",
  "results.web_browser": "A web browser title has the advantage of running from any device and most browsers. This permits the game to be played even on mobile phones if the interface is responsive."
