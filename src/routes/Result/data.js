      pc: `
      Video games have become part of our lives, as virtual realities and escape places we all access for new experiences. PC is one of the platforms with more innovation in its history due to a more diverse, modular set of hardware and, in general, a more powerful one.
PCs always had the advantage of being highly configurable based on available hardware, as well as personal preferences.

PC games have the advantage of being universally compatible with any hardware ranging from 10 years in the past, to 10 years in the future. This greatly expands the target audience it can reach.

Since the 1970â€™s 3.5 billion computers have been shipped, many of which are still around and ready to be used by potential users. Being such a versatile platform, the games on PC can use all the monetization models available.

      client: `
      Having a standalone client is a great solution for larger games that would be hindered by web browser limitations. Modern game engines like Unreal and Unity offer great support and a lot of options in terms of assets, plugin and other modules that could be used.

      Even with digital content downloaded to their own sistem from a server, players get the feeling of ownership, the same feeling people get when buying physical copies.

      web_browser: `
      A web browser title has the advantage of running from any device and most browsers. This permits the game to be played even on mobile phones if the interface is responsive.

      Nintendo started making consoles with 2 generations ahead of its modern day competitors, Sony and Microsoft.

Usually, games that do well with Nintendo audiences are family friendly, with rich fantasy stories.

      f2p: `
      In this specific case, we will focus on the Free 2 Play monetization model. With a free game there is no barrier to entry. The player will tailor his own experience based on his choice of spending money for utility and cosmetic items or time. 
      This works best when users that spend time grinding in the game have the tools to transfer their goods to the people willing to pay the publisher money for the trade currency.

      b2p: `
      Buying the game is a first step for creating a loyal playerbase, as ownership over his personal copy creates the feeling of being part of the game world and the community around it. 
      Many consider B2P a fair option as you pay once and get the full experience, compared to F2P where you have to constantly adapt to new content and invest time or money to complete content.
      The last few years have seen a surge in new types of monetization options bundling with Buy2Play, such as DLCs and PreOrders. With DLCs you can expand the game content without creating a new game, while preorders are a technique to get money from the players before the risk of unfavorable reviews. Today, hype is king.

      subscription: `
      The subscription model has been popularized starting with the rise of MMOs, where companies started focusing more on player retention, rather than just the flat one time payment rate. Subscriptions work in a similar way on how retail copies worked, with a sense of ownership. After paying a 6 months subscription, the user is planning to spend time in the game, as he already paid and gets some extra rewards for being active.
